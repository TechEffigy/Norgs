## Status

Project is running, still needs improvement, need to adjust parameters, refactor, and restructure.
It was suppose to be a quick experiment that went out of control.

## Description

Agents placed into an enviroment containing goals. Each agent is controlled by a neural network optimized using the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Training commences everytime an agent breaks the record of most rewards gained.

## Running

This project uses Webpack and Babel. To run the project, Yarn dev, or yarn build.
